# Understanding concepts
Concepts bridge the gap between ideation and production. With CDM, you can:
- Generate, capture, analyze, and approve **product concepts** that address your company's strategic goals 
- Transfer approved concepts directly to PLM solutions for prototype planning, detailed design, and prototyping

The following use-cases highlight how you can use CDM to suit your role:
- **Product architects**: Use concepts to align toward strategy goals like optimal material and development costs, features, roadmap, partnership objectives, and future technology migration.
- **Product managers**: Compare and optimize competing concepts to support product strategy goals, and securely share the results with existing and potential supply chain partners or external design teams.
- **Executives**: Trace concepts in detail from ideas and requirements to finished products, for engineering clarifications, process analysis and improvement activities.

## Concept creation methods
Create a concept using any of the following options:
- From ideas and formal requirements
- From existing concepts or concept templates (using Save-As)  
  Create a copy of an original concept and its proposal for the following advantages:  
  - Reuse specific concept versions
  - Select a different concept type from the original
  - Retain or remove content details of the original concept, including structure, attachments and designs, requirements, references, and team
  - Retain or remove content details of the original proposal, including cost, revenue, resources, attachments, references, and projects
    ```Note:: You can copy concept-type specific attributes only if the source and target concept types match.
    ```
- As independent concepts  
  Create an independent concept to own it entirely. This enables you to define concept structures that fulfil ideas and requirements specific to your prototypes and future designs.

## Concept attributes

**Concept Type**: Preset values that define the grouping and search criteria of concepts. Choose among the preset values when you create a concept. You cannot modify this value in the concept later.  
To create unique concept types, contact your system administrator.  

**Concept Status**: Predefined states in a workflow that define the actions you can take at each stage. The following table details the different states:

| Status    | Workflow Stage                                                                                                                                                           |
|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Draft     | Design. This is the default status of a concept you create. As the concept owner, you can modify the concept structure as you require.                                   |
| Submitted | Review. Submit a concept for review once you complete your concept design. You cannot make any further changes to the concept.                                           |
| Approved  | Approved. You can move an approved concept to a PLM system for production. The data of an approved concept continues to be available in CDM, as an item structure. |
| Rejected  | Design. A concept that has been rejected in the Review stage reverts back to the Draft status. You can modify it if you are the concept owner.                           |

## Concept versions
Create and use versions of a concept to save and track the progress of your concept design. 

Points to remember:
- When you create a version of a concept, all the data of the source concept is copied into the newer version, and it is automatically numbered to the respective highest version number available. 
- All previous versions are rendered read-only.
- You can edit only the latest version of a concept.
- To reuse and edit an older concept version, create a version from it, or create a copy of it using Save As.

The following image shows how concept versions are numbered.

```Note:: Concepts and proposals can have versions independent of each other.
```

## What are requirements and proposals?
Requirements, concepts, and proposals are elements of the IM product suite, and work together intrinsically.

**Requirements** are design specifications that serve as inputs for concepts. Requirements also help measure the completeness of a concept.  
You can also build requirements specifications from concept designs, for use in future product redesigning activities.

**Concepts** address the technical design aspect of a product. You cannot delete a concept which has a requirement assigned to it, without disassociating them first.

**Proposals** contain the business information for concepts. When you create a concept, CDM creates a proposal of the same name; the converse applies as well. A concept and a proposal cannot contain sufficient information individually to justify a new project, and are hence created alongside each other.  
When you delete a proposal, the corresponding concept is also deleted.
```Note:: You cannot delete a concept-proposal pair if the concept is in *Submitted* or *Approved* state. Deletion is possible only if both, the proposal and concept, are in *Draft* or *Rejected* state.
   ```
