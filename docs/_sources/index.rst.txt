**About this site:**

   Hi there! 
   
   Thanks for stopping by. Here's a quick summary of this website:
   
   - Tools used: Sphinx with a `*Read-the-Docs* <https://sphinx-rtd-theme.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html#>` theme (tweaked for style and added functionality like reST tabs).  
   - Source content: Chapters from a DITA-based user guide that I authored in a previous role. Click `here <https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E48434_01/doc.1118/e48178/title.htm>`_ to view the guide in its original format.
   
   Yes, that's my cat posing as the website logo! :-)
