# Analyzing concepts

Analyze a concept in terms of target costs, compliance, requirements fulfilled, or similar parameters to make informed decisions on the concept's lifecycle.

## Roll-up a concept
To compare target and actual metrics of units in a concept structure, click the *Roll-up* button. This action calculates the variance in the actual and target metric attributes across all units of the concept structure, as applicable.  
In the *Metrics* view, a warning icon next to concept structure units indicates unfavorable variance values.

A roll-up calculates the following metrics:
- Cost, weight, and power consumption
- Compliance
- Fulfilled requirements
- Status
- Concept score

``` tabs::
	
	.. tab:: Cost, weight, and power consumption
	    
		Aggregates of the total values of linked items, concept components, and embedded concepts, up to the top-level concept.
		
		Total cost calculations:  
		 - Total cost of an individual item or concept component = Material Cost + Non-Material Cost  
		 - Total cost of a concept component assembly = Non-Material Cost + Aggregate of (Total cost of each item or component * Respective Quantities per Assembly)  
		 - Total Weight of a concept component assembly = Aggregate of (Actual Weights of each linked item, concept component, and embedded concept * Respective Quantities)  
		 - Total Power Consumption of a concept component assembly = Aggregate of (Actual Power Consumption of each linked item, concept component and embedded concept * Respective Quantities)
		 
	.. tab:: Compliance
	    
		The compliance status of a concept component or a linked item defines the compliance of the next higher-level component.  
		
		The compliance statuses of items are read directly from PLM. They are mapped as either compliant or noncompliant items in CDM, depending on the completeness of information available.  
		A noncompliant item or component renders its higher-level component noncompliant also.     	
		
	.. tab:: Fulfilled requirements
	    
		The number of assigned and fulfilled requirements per individual components in the concept structure, as applicable.  
		
		This analysis aids in fine-tuning the accuracy of a proposed concept design in meeting user needs.
		 
	.. tab:: Status
	    
		The statuses of individual components and linked items in a concept assembly decide the aggregated status of the higher-level component, upto the top-level concept.  
		
		You can link items from PLM in the concept structure if they are in either conceptual, preliminary, or production stage.
		 
	.. tab:: Score
	    
		Assessment of solution alternatives against design objectives.  
		
		Concept-level scores calculation:
		 - the number of items in the structure, compared to concept components. Reuse of items scores extra points.
		 - the number of items with scores higher than the target value 85. A high percentage of high-scoring items in the structure raises the concept score.
		 - the number of items missing data such as compliance status, lead time, number of manufacturers, or preferred status. Complete items rank high.

### View metrics in a Spider Chart
Use a spider chart to view and compare aggregated metrics across multiple solution alternatives, in an graphical or tabular form.  

Metrics are normalized - the chart calculates the relative deviation of each actual value from the target value, and displays positive or negative deviations from the target value.

The *Table view* summarizes the data of the Spider Chart (calculated variance and metrics per solution alternatives) for quick reference.
